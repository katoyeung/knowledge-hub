# Prompt Seeder Implementation

## Overview

I have successfully created a comprehensive prompt seeder that extracts and seeds prompts from the existing project. The seeder includes 7 different prompt templates that cover various use cases found in the codebase.

## What Was Created

### 1. Prompt Seeder (`apps/backend/src/database/seeds/initial-prompts.seed.ts`)

The seeder includes the following prompts extracted from the project:

#### 1. **RAG Chat Assistant** (from chat service)

- **Type**: `chat`
- **Purpose**: Generic RAG prompt for document-based question answering
- **Source**: Extracted from `apps/backend/src/modules/chat/services/chat.service.ts`
- **Features**: Context prioritization, fallback to general knowledge, source attribution

#### 2. **Document Data Extractor** (from CMS)

- **Type**: `custom`
- **Purpose**: Extract structured data from news articles about supply chain events
- **Source**: Extracted from `apps/cms/src/pages/posts/analyze.tsx`
- **Features**: JSON schema validation, date parsing, impact level classification

#### 3. **Technical Documentation Assistant**

- **Type**: `system`
- **Purpose**: Specialized assistant for technical documentation and software development
- **Features**: Code formatting, structured explanations, best practices

#### 4. **Content Summarizer**

- **Type**: `intention`
- **Purpose**: Create concise summaries of long-form content
- **Features**: Key point extraction, tone preservation, actionable insights

#### 5. **Code Review Assistant**

- **Type**: `custom`
- **Purpose**: Expert code review with focus on quality and security
- **Features**: Bug detection, performance analysis, security checks, best practices

#### 6. **Meeting Notes Generator**

- **Type**: `intention`
- **Purpose**: Convert meeting transcripts into structured notes
- **Features**: Action item extraction, responsibility assignment, deadline tracking

#### 7. **Professional Email Writer**

- **Type**: `custom`
- **Purpose**: Generate professional emails for various business contexts
- **Features**: Tone adaptation, proper formatting, context awareness

### 2. Updated Seed Runner (`apps/backend/src/database/seeds/run-seed.ts`)

- Added prompt seeding to the main seed runner
- Integrated with existing seed process
- Proper error handling and logging

### 3. System User Creation

- Creates a system user (`system@knowledge-hub.com`) for global prompts
- All seeded prompts are marked as global and active
- Proper user relationship management

## Key Features

### Prompt Structure

Each prompt includes:

- **Name**: Descriptive title
- **System Prompt**: The main AI instruction template
- **User Prompt Template**: Template for user input (with placeholders)
- **Description**: Clear explanation of the prompt's purpose
- **Type**: Categorized as `intention`, `chat`, `system`, or `custom`
- **JSON Schema**: Validation schema for template variables
- **Global Access**: All prompts are available to all users
- **Active Status**: Ready to use immediately

### Template Variables

Prompts use placeholder variables like:

- `{{context}}` - For document context
- `{{question}}` - For user questions
- `{{content}}` - For content to process
- `{{code}}` - For code to review
- `{{transcript}}` - For meeting transcripts

## How to Use

### 1. Run the Seeder

```bash
cd apps/backend
npm run seed
```

### 2. Access Prompts via API

```bash
# Get all prompts
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3001/prompts" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"

# Get specific prompt
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3001/prompts/PROMPT_ID" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

### 3. Use in Frontend

The prompts are now available in the frontend at `/settings/prompts` where you can:

- View all seeded prompts
- Edit existing prompts
- Create new prompts
- Test prompt templates

## Testing

### 1. Test API Endpoints

```bash
# Test prompts API (requires authentication)
node test-prompts-api.js
```

### 2. Verify in Database

```sql
-- Check if prompts were seeded
SELECT name, type, is_global, is_active FROM prompts;

-- Check system user
SELECT email, name FROM users WHERE email = 'system@knowledge-hub.com';
```

### 3. Frontend Testing

1. Start the frontend: `npm run dev:frontend`
2. Navigate to `/settings/prompts`
3. Verify all 7 prompts are visible
4. Test creating, editing, and deleting prompts

## Integration Points

### 1. Chat Service Integration

The RAG Chat Assistant prompt can be used to replace the hardcoded prompt in the chat service:

```typescript
// In chat.service.ts, replace the hardcoded prompt with:
const prompt = await this.promptService.findOne({
  where: { name: "RAG Chat Assistant" },
});
const systemPrompt = prompt.systemPrompt
  .replace("{{context}}", context)
  .replace("{{question}}", query);
```

### 2. CMS Integration

The Document Data Extractor can be used in the CMS for automated data extraction from news articles.

### 3. Custom Use Cases

All prompts are designed to be reusable and can be customized for specific needs through the frontend interface.

## Benefits

1. **Centralized Management**: All prompts in one place
2. **Reusability**: Templates can be used across different modules
3. **Customization**: Easy to modify prompts without code changes
4. **Version Control**: Track prompt changes over time
5. **A/B Testing**: Test different prompt variations
6. **Documentation**: Each prompt is well-documented with descriptions and schemas

## Next Steps

1. **Integration**: Update chat service to use the RAG prompt from the database
2. **Customization**: Allow users to create their own prompt variations
3. **Analytics**: Track prompt usage and effectiveness
4. **Templates**: Create more specialized prompts for specific domains
5. **Testing**: Add automated tests for prompt functionality

## Files Modified/Created

- ✅ `apps/backend/src/database/seeds/initial-prompts.seed.ts` (new)
- ✅ `apps/backend/src/database/seeds/run-seed.ts` (updated)
- ✅ `apps/backend/src/modules/user/user.entity.ts` (updated - added prompts relationship)
